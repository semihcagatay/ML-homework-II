# ML-homework-II
Second homework of the Machine Learning  course 
This project implements the decision tree algorithm 
This project also implements this algorithm bu using the grid search algorithm
The libraries used for this homeworks are 

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import os

Please install those libraries from the terminal
